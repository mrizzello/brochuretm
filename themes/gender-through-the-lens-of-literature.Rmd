Reading is a unique source of pleasure, but literature does more than
entertain---it reflects and critiques the society in which it is
created. It reveals how concepts of gender---femininity, masculinity,
and non-binary identities---have been constructed, reinforced, or
challenged over time. These representations shape not only how
individuals understand themselves and others but also how broader
cultural conversations unfold.

This research project invites you to choose one work of literature in
English through which you will explore the theme of gender. You might
study, for example, how : 

- characters embody or resist traditional gender roles
- texts reflect struggles for equality and representation
- language and narrative voice influence ideas about gender
- themes of love, sexuality, and identity emerge across genres and periods
- literature participates in wider debates on diversity and social justice

Your project may include : 

- developing hypotheses about gender representation
- comparing how different authors, genres, or historical periods address gender
- examining how a literary work on gender is adapted into another medium (film, TV series, etc.)

This assignment is designed for students who wish to reflect on
questions of gender in literature and for those curious about how
femininity, masculinity, and non-binary identities are represented
across time. It appeals to readers interested in social change and
cultural diversity, as well as to those who enjoy analyzing how
literature both challenges and reinforces stereotypes. Above all, it
offers an opportunity to connect literary analysis with contemporary
debates on equality and identity.
